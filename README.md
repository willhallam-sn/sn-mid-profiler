# sn-mid-profiler
scoped app to populate a MID profile based on a currently running MID

**Disclaimer: This example automation is provided for informational purposes and comes with no warranty or support.

**Setup Notes
In order to retrieve the wrapper-override.conf from a Linux MID, you need an SSH key credential set up which can access the MID.  Associate it with alias "x_snc_mid_profiler.linux_mid_ssh".  If there is an issue with that credential or alias accessing the MID, the "Ingest Linux MID File" action will error out.
